	* cr16-dis.c (make_instruction): Rename to cr16_make_instruction.
	(match_opcode): Rename to cr16_match_opcode.

2013-01-04  Juergen Urban <JuergenUrban@gmx.de>

	* mips-dis.c: Add names for CP0 registers of r5900.
	* mips-opc.c: Add M_SQ_AB and M_LQ_AB to support larger range for
	instructions sq and lq.
	Add support for MIPS r5900 CPU.
	Add support for 128 bit MMI (Multimedia Instructions).
	Add support for EE instructions (Emotion Engine).
	Disable unsupported floating point instructions (64 bit and
	undefined compare operations).
	Enable instructions of MIPS ISA IV which are supported by r5900.
	Disable 64 bit co processor instructions.
	Disable 64 bit multiplication and division instructions.
	Disable instructions for co-processor 2 and 3, because these are
	not supported (preparation for later VU0 support (Vector Unit)).
	Disable cvt.w.s because this behaves like trunc.w.s and the
	correct execution can't be ensured on r5900.
	Add trunc.w.s using the opcode encoding of cvt.w.s on r5900. This
	will confuse less developers and compilers.

	* aarch64-opc.c (aarch64_print_operand): Change to print
	AARCH64_OPND_IMM_MOV in hexadecimal in the instruction and in decimal
	in comment.
	* aarch64-tbl.h (aarch64_opcode_table): Remove the 'F_PSEUDO' flag
	from the opcode entries of OP_MOV_IMM_LOG, OP_MOV_IMM_WIDEN and
	OP_MOV_IMM_WIDE.

2013-01-04  Yufeng Zhang  <yufeng.zhang@arm.com>

	* aarch64-opc.c (aarch64_prfops): Update to support PLIL1KEEP,
	PLIL1STRM, PLIL2KEEP, PLIL2STRM, PLIL3KEEP and PLIL3STRM.

2013-01-02  H.J. Lu  <hongjiu.lu@intel.com>

	* i386-gen.c (process_copyright): Update copyright year to 2013.

2013-01-02  Kaushik Phatak  <kaushik.phatak@kpitcummins.com>

	* cr16-dis.c (match_opcode,make_instruction): Remove static
	declaration.
	(dwordU,wordU): Moved typedefs to opcode/cr16.h
	(cr16_words,cr16_allWords,cr16_currInsn): Added prefix 'cr16_'.

{"name":"Binutils","tagline":"Distrotech binutils fork","body":"\t\t   README for GNU development tools\r\n\r\nThis directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, \r\ndebuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.\r\n\r\nIf you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file gdb/README.\r\nIf with a binutils release, see binutils/README;  if with a libg++ release,\r\nsee libg++/README, etc.  That'll give you info about this\r\npackage -- supported targets, how to use it, how to report bugs, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of\r\ntools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,\r\nrun the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:\r\n\r\n\t./configure \r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nTo install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),\r\nthen do:\r\n\tmake install\r\n\r\n(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it\r\nthe name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can\r\nuse the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if\r\nit is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,\r\nand OS.)\r\n\r\nIf you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to\r\nexplicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to\r\nalso set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):\r\n\r\n\tCC=gcc ./configure\r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nA similar example using csh:\r\n\r\n\tsetenv CC gcc\r\n\t./configure\r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nMuch of the code and documentation enclosed is copyright by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, Inc.  See the file COPYING or\r\nCOPYING.LIB in the various directories, for a description of the\r\nGNU General Public License terms under which you can copy the files.\r\n\r\nREPORTING BUGS: Again, see gdb/README, binutils/README, etc., for info\r\non where and how to report problems.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
